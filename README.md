# Deep Learning models to evaluate Website Aesthetics

Website aesthetics play an important role in attracting users and customers as
well as in enhancing user experience.

In this repository, we develop deep learning models that can evaluate the aesthetics of a website achieving high correlation with the human perception.

## Datasets

For the training process, we rely on 2 different datasets.

* **Rating-based dataset**: The users were asked to rate a webpage screenshot by providing an explicit numerical value on a scale

* **Comparison-based dataset**: The users were asked to compare 2 different webpage screenshots at a time and choose which of the two is preferable

You can find more about these datasets [here](https://github.com/calista-ai/website-aesthetics-datasets).
